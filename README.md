### Hey! ✌️

I'm a 15 year old currently learning Lua in my spare time! Check out my released game [Tiny Tank](dot32.itch.io) that i made in Love2D

I first started making games on [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu/users/dot32) when I was 9 years old, and have decided to try step it up with a little more serious programming. I've made a crappy website ( [dot32.netlify.app](dot32.netlify.app) ) and i've released my first game, which i am super proud of :D

If you would like to contact me, message me through my discord by adding Dot32#2572

Listen to the song I made on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/dot32/journey-to-the-clouds) that im also quite proud of, currently sat on 130+ listens from last time I checked
