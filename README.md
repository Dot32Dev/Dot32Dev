### Hei ✌️
A 15 year old learning <img alt="Lua" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/lua-%232C2D72.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=lua&logoColor=white"/>. I started making games on [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Dot32/) when I was 9 years old, and im only now really stepping it up.

- Check out my offically released game, [Tiny Tank](https://dot32.itch.io/tiny-tank)!
- Check out my crappy website ([dot32.netlify.app](https://dot32.netlify.app/index.html))
- Listen to the song I released on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/dot32/journey-to-the-clouds) that im also quite proud of, currently sat on 130+ listens from last time I checked 👌 

Contact me through discord Dot32#1186
